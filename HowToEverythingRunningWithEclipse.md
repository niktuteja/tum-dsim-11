# Eclipse setup #
To get Eclipse working with the Google Code repo perform the following two steps:

  * Checkout https://tum-dsim-11.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/DiscreteEventSimulator (follow this tutorial if needed: http://blog.msbbc.co.uk/2007/06/using-googles-free-svn-repository-with.html)

  * Setup the Eclipse plugin Mylyn to work with the bugtracker of our Google Code repository (see http://eclipse.dzone.com/articles/using-mylyn-with-google-code-u)

# SVN structure #

  * The code for the discrete event simulator is in trunk/DiscreteEventSimulator

  * For each exercise sheet / assignment we can create a SVN 'tag' (e.g. tags/Assignment1, tags/Assignment2).
