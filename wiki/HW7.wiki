- In M/M systems a single but fast service unit yields smaller average and maximum waiting queue lengths.

- In M/D and D/M systems the ten (slow) service units perform slightly better than one singe fast unit.

- In M/M systems a single but fast service unit yields much smaller average and maximum passthrough times.

- In M/D and D/M systems the ten (slow) service units yield smaller average and maximum waiting times but much slower service times


*Answer for Exercise 1.d*:

Best performance from...

... a customer's perspective:
  * If customers prefer shorter passthrough times then they prefer having a single, fast service unit.
  * If customers prefer shorter waiting times then they either prefer a single fast service unit in an M/M system or several slower service units in an M/D or D/M system.

... the shop owner's perspective
  * prefers a small passthrough time in order to process as many customers as possible. Therefore the shop owner prefers one fast service unit.
